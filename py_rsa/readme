RSA Encryption Algorithm in python

Written by Evan Wilde

Description:
	This program is a working encryption system implemented
	in python. It was originally intended as an execercise,
	but will work for real applications.

	It takes a message and a public key to encrypt a to a
	cipher text, or it will take a private key and a cipher
	to decrypt a message. The program can also generate
	a public and private key set, which can ben used.

	The private key is currently stored in plain text
	however, in the future it may be encrypted using a user
	password.

Useage:
	-k: Generate keys
	-e [public key] [message]: Encrypt message with public key
	-d [private key] [cipher]: Decrypt cipher with private key
