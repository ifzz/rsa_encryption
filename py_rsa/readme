RSA Encryption Algorithm in python

Written by Evan Wilde

Description:
	This program is a working encryption system implemented
	in python. It was originally intended as an execercise,
	but will work for real applications where encryption is
	necessary.

	The program can generate usable rsa public and private
	key pairs. It can use a generated public key and a plain
	text message and encrypt it, or use a private key and a
	cipher text message and decrypt it. 

	The private key is currently stored in plain text
	however, in the future it may be encrypted using a user
	password.

Usage: ./rsa [argument] [options]
    -k : Generate Keys
    -e [public key] [message]: Encrypt a message
    -d [private key [ciphertext]: Decrypt a message
    -fe [public key] [files]: Encrypt a set of files
    -fd [private key] [files]: Decrypt a set of files
